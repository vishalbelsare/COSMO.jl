## Version 0.8.7 (04. March 2023)
This release contains a number of minor bug fixes and typo removals. It also includes some cleanup tasks like updating dependencies and fixing an issue with the documentation build job.

`3cf312a` - Update MOI_wrapper.jl (#169)
`724a2d2` - Update QDLDL wrappers for QDLDL v0.4.1 (#171)
`9ebf334` - fix: merge_strategy() is an instance, not a type (#164)

## Version 0.8.0 (02. February 2021)
This is a fairly big release as we wrap the ADMM algorithm into a safeguarded Anderson Acceleration method. The accelerators are provided by [COSMOAccelerators.jl](https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/COSMOAccelerators.jl). This should improve the convergence to higher accuracy solution. 

We change the default settings to reflect this. The default accuracies `eps_abs` and `eps_rel` are set to `1e-5`, we now check convergence every `25` iterations, and increased `max_iter` to `5000`. Acceleration can be switched off by using: `COSMO.Settings(accelerator = EmptyAccelerator)`.  When the algorithm is safeguarded (`safeguard = true`), extra ADMM-iteration called `safeguarding_iter` might occur which are also reported to the user. The returned number of iterations in the result object always refers to the total number of ADMM-iterations, which includes the `safeguarding_iter`s. Refer to the docs for more configuration options.

## Version 0.7.3 (15. June 2020)
- We significantly improved the solver performance in this release. This is mainly achieved by direct assembly of the KKT matrix in CSC format, faster permutation and getting rid of some function overhead related to the `SplitVector` type. Moreover, we now made the solver precision type-agnostic, which means you can use any AbstractFloat type, e.g. `BigFloat` for your problem data (some limitations apply, see docs) and COSMO will solve the problem with that type.

- `0b0f3b3` Always time `iter_start`
- `6ff52a8` Make chordal decomposition code type agnostic

- `b3c15ed` faster norms and l/r scaling
- `55f4511` faster qdldl


## Version 0.7.2 (22. March 2020)
- We now handle the optional dependencies of external linear solver packages `Pardiso` and `IterativeSolvers` by using the `Requires.jl` package. Furthermore, we improve convergence of problems with box constraints in many cases. We also allow an automatic adaptive rho interval option, like in OSQP, which can be activated by setting `adaptive_rho_interval = 0` (automatic).

- The main commits in this new version are:
- `ecef91d` ü§ù  Improve handling of optional dependencies
- `70c6067` Merge branch 'mg/adaptive_rho_intervall'

- `d8dfe26` Prevent decomposition from mutating settings

## Version 0.7.0 (05. March 2020)
- This release adds support for indirect linear system solver from the `IterativeSolvers.jl` package. We also drop support of PsdConeSquare constraints ins MOI. By default MOI will bridge them to PSDTriangle constraints. We further fixed a number of bugs related to the compact transformation for decomposable SDPs. Another change is that when used with `verbose_timing = true`, COSMO will now measure the initial factorisation time and the time for refactorisations separately.
The major commits are listed here:

- `439f218` Return NearlyFeasible status code if max_iter reached
