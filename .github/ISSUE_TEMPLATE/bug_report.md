Welcome to COSMO!

Thanks for sharing a bug with us. To help us investigate the issue quickly, please include the following information:

- the version of `COSMO` (and possibly `MathOptInterface` and `JuMP`) that you are using. To find this information use the Julia package manager. Type `]` and `pkg> status`.

- does the issue go away when you update above packages to their latest versions?

- a [minimal reproducible example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_working_example) to allow us to reproduce the issue.

If you want to contribute a bug fix yourself, you can follow our guide [How-to-develop](https://oxfordcontrol.github.io/COSMO.jl/dev/contributing/#How-to-develop).

Thanks for contributing to COSMO.
